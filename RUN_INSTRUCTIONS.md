# How to run this Job-Portal project (step-by-step, beginner friendly)

## Overview
This project has two parts:
- `Backend` (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- `Frontend` (React + Vite)

We'll run both locally in VS Code and connect them.

---
## Prerequisites (install before starting)
- Node.js (v16+). Download from https://nodejs.org/
- Git (optional) and VS Code.
- MongoDB: either a local MongoDB server, or MongoDB Atlas (cloud). If you use Atlas, get the connection string (URI).

## Steps (full walkthrough)
1. **Open the project in VS Code**
   - In VS Code: `File -> Open Folder` -> select the project folder (the one that contains `Backend` and `Frontend`).

2. **Prepare the backend**
   - Open a new terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`).
   - `cd Backend`
   - Create `.env` by copying the provided `.env` file and fill in real values:
     - `MONGO_URI` = your MongoDB URI (e.g. `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority`)
     - `JWT_SECRET` = a long random string (e.g. generated by a password manager)
     - `PORT` = 5011 (or another free port)
     - CLOUDINARY values if you plan to use file uploads (optional)
   - Install packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start server in dev mode:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     or start normally:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - If everything is fine you'll see: `Server is running on port 5011` and the backend will connect to MongoDB.

3. **Prepare and run the frontend**
   - Open a second terminal in VS Code.
   - `cd Frontend`
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the dev server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Vite will show a local URL such as `http://localhost:5173` — open that in your browser.

4. **Connect frontend to backend (CORS & base URLs)**
   - The backend listens on `PORT` (e.g. 5011). The frontend must send HTTP requests to `http://localhost:5011/api/...`.
   - Search in the `Frontend/src` code for API base URLs. Two common approaches:
     - The frontend uses an `axios` instance with `baseURL`. Set that to `http://localhost:5011`.
     - Or set a `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable for Vite (create `.env` in `Frontend`):
       ```env
       VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5011
       ```
     - Then in code use `import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL`.
   - If you get CORS errors, ensure backend `index.js` has `app.use(cors())` (it does by default).

5. **Testing endpoints quickly**
   - Use Postman / Insomnia / curl to test endpoints:
     - `POST http://localhost:5011/api/user/register`
     - `POST http://localhost:5011/api/user/login`
   - Use browser devtools to watch network calls from the frontend and see full request/response details.

6. **Common problems & fixes**
   - **Problem:** `MongoNetworkError` or connection refused → check `MONGO_URI` and that MongoDB is reachable (if local, make sure mongod is running).
   - **Problem:** `CORS` errors → confirm frontend is calling `http://localhost:5011` and backend uses `cors()`.
   - **Problem:** Missing `JWT_SECRET` → set it in `.env`.
   - **Problem:** File uploads fail → confirm Cloudinary credentials or change code to store files locally for development.

7. **Packaging and deployment (brief)**
   - **Backend**: Use a provider (Heroku, Railway, Render, or a VPS). Ensure environment variables are set in the provider dashboard and the `start` script exists (`npm start`). Use `Procfile` for Heroku if needed.
   - **Frontend**: Build for production `npm run build` then host on Netlify, Vercel or static hosting. Set the production backend URL in the built code or via environment variables on the host.

If you want, I can produce an automated checklist you can follow in VS Code and also create a `.env.example` you can fill in. I also created a small `Backend/README_RUN.md` inside the backend folder.
